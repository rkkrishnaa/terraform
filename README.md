# terraform-ansible
This repo contains useful terraform modules and workspace for automating your infrastructure provisioning.

I have added ansible role for deploying elk stack in a ubuntu server.

I have added terraform module and workspace for setting up alerts for rds and redis cache cluster. You can use provisioners as well as external providers to pass the dynamic value to orchestrate the deployment.
